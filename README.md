# sorted-double-linked-list-

Create MyDDLLwithHandT class (a sorted double linked list with header and trailer) which contains the following methods.
1.	Insert a value in the list (keep the list sorted in ascending order)
2.	Search for a value in the list (return a pointer to the node containing the value if found, null otherwise)
3.	Delete a value from the list (make use the search method)
4.	Print the content of a list
5.	Merge two sorted lists in a sorted list
6.	Count how many nodes contain a value that is divisible by a given value V.

Create a main class to test your MyDDLLwithHandT class, which contains the following methods:
•	Create 4 lists: list1, list2, list3 and list4 of type MyDDLLwithHandT
•	Write a method to generate randomly numbers between 20 and 60
  i.	Insert 10 integers (do not insert duplicates) into list1. 
  ii.	Insert 15 integers (do not insert duplicates) into list2.
•	Merge list1 and list2 into list3
•	Write a method to find the average of the even numbers in a list.
•	Given two lists, write a method to find the elements that are in one of the list but not in the other list and insert them into a fourth list. 
•	Test these methods.
